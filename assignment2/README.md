# Assignment 2

In the assignment 2, you will be building a scantron OCR application in Python Flask. The application handles:

* Scantron submission
* Format validation
* Score calculation against answer keys
* Score reporting

All the above features will be handled via a set of REST APIs. The application will persist data into a local SQLite DB.
